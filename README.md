# shortest-word-ladder
Implemented a word ladder generator in C, capable of finding the shortest path between two words in a dictionary. The program utilizes a linked list data structure to represent word ladders, where each node contains a word of the specified length. It employs a binary search algorithm to efficiently locate words in the dictionary and a breadth-first search approach to explore potential ladder paths. The program handles interactive user input for setting word parameters and provides informative error messages. Additionally, memory management functions are implemented to free up dynamically allocated memory.

Key Features:

Dynamic memory allocation for word arrays and ladder nodes.
Binary search for efficient word retrieval from the dictionary.
Breadth-first search algorithm for finding the shortest word ladder.
Interactive user input handling with error checking.
Memory management functions to free allocated memory.
Technologies: C, Linked List, Binary Search, Breadth-First Search, Dynamic Memory Allocation.
